Here are the key things it does:\\n\\n- Defines two enum constants - X and O. These represent the two possible symbols that can be used in a tic-tac-toe game.\\n\\n- Symbol is an enum, so it cannot be instantiated with the new operator. The only possible values are the predefined constants X and O.\\n\\n- Provides a type-safe way to represent the two possible symbols in the game code. Variables can be declared as type Symbol rather than using strings or ints.\\n\\n- Helps avoid errors from passing invalid symbol values like passing \\\&quot;1\\\&quot; instead of X. The enum forces using only the predefined values.\\n\\n- Acts as a self-documenting definition of the possible symbols in one place. Any code using Symbol knows the only options without external documentation.\\n\\n- Can be extended in the future if more symbols are needed without changing the API. New constants can be added to the enum.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a type-safe representation of the two possible tic-tac-toe symbols as an enum with constants X and O. This provides a clean API for any code interacting with symbols in the game.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/models/players/Player.java\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines an interface for a Player model in a tic-tac-toe or similar game.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It is defined in the package models.players, indicating it is a model class for players.\\n\\n- It defines an interface Player rather than a class. This means any class that implements this interface must define the methods listed.\\n\\n- It imports the Symbol class from the models.game package, indicating players will use Symbols.\\n\\n- It defines two methods:\\n  - getName(): Returns the name of the player as a String\\n  - getSymbol(): Returns the Symbol (X or O) that this player uses\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- It defines a standard interface for what a \\\&quot;Player\\\&quot; is in terms of this game\\n- Any class that implements Player must provide a name and symbol \\n- This allows different player types (human, AI etc) but they all work the same way to the rest of the game code\\n- It ties the player to the Symbol model from the game package\\n\\nSo the key functions are getName() and getSymbol() which provide the basic player data needed for a game. The interface standardizes how \\\&quot;Player\\\&quot; classes must work.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/models/players/BotPlayer.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines a BotPlayer class that represents a bot or computer-controlled player in a game.\\n\\nKey things we can infer:\\n\\n- It is in the models.players package, indicating it models a type of player.\\n\\n- BotPlayer extends the base Player class (not shown), so it inherits common player functionality.\\n\\n- As a bot player, it will likely have AI/logic to make automated decisions and moves in the game instead of being directly controlled by a human player.\\n\\nSome potential key functions it may have:\\n\\n- makeMove() - Method for the bot to automatically select and make a move. Would contain the AI/decision logic.\\n\\n- getPossibleMoves() - Method to evaluate the current game state and return valid move options. \\n\\n- updateState() - Method called after each turn to update the bot\\u0027s internal representation of the game state.\\n\\n- getName() - Method to return the name/identifier of the bot player.\\n\\nSo in summary, this class defines a computer-controlled player that can autonomously participate in a game using AI/algorithmic logic rather than needing direct human input. The key responsibilities are automated decision making and updating its game state perspective.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/models/players/Difficulty.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines an enum called Difficulty.\\n\\nKey things about it:\\n\\n- It is located in the package models.players, indicating it defines a model related to players.\\n\\n- Difficulty is an enum, which means it defines a fixed set of difficulty levels that can be selected from. \\n\\n- No difficulty levels are defined yet, it is currently empty. Typically enums would define constants for each possible value, like:\\n\\npublic enum Difficulty {\\n  EASY, \\n  NORMAL,\\n  HARD\\n}\\n\\n- This enum is likely used to represent different difficulty levels a player can select in a game. Code would use the Difficulty enum to check/set the current difficulty, for example:\\n\\nDifficulty currentDifficulty \\u003d Difficulty.HARD;\\n\\n- Key functions/usages would be:\\n  - Getter to retrieve the current Difficulty value\\n  - Setter to change the Difficulty value\\n  - Methods to handle different game logic/stats based on difficulty\\n\\nSo in summary, this enum sets up a type to represent different difficulty levels in the game that can be selected, even though the specific levels aren\\u0027t defined yet.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/models/players/HumanPlayer.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines a class called HumanPlayer that represents a human player in a game.\\n\\nKey things about this class:\\n\\n- It is in the models.players package, indicating it is a player model class.\\n\\n- It extends the Player class (or implements the Player interface, not shown), so it can be used as a Player.\\n\\n- It has no fields or methods defined yet. This is just a placeholder class for a human player.\\n\\nSome key functions it would likely need:\\n\\n- Methods to get user input, like getMove() to get the player\\u0027s desired move.\\n\\n- Methods to display information to the user, like displayBoard() or displayMessage(). \\n\\n- A method to check if it\\u0027s the player\\u0027s turn, like isMyTurn().\\n\\n- Possibly fields to store the player\\u0027s name, score, etc.\\n\\n- Getter/setter methods for any fields.\\n\\nSo in summary, this class serves as a blueprint for representing a human player that can interact with the game via input/output and take their turn appropriately through the player interface. More specific functionality would need to be added to make it a fully functional player class.\&quot;}&quot;}" />
